I made this project while following a tutorial, to mainly learn about deployment.

To run:

1) Set up and activate a python3 venv

2) Install python dependencies from requirements.txt

3) Get an API KEY from https://openweathermap.org/ and set up your API_KEY environment variable

4) Run "py server.py" command and visit "localhost:8000" in a web browser
